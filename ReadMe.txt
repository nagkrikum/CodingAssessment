Assumption:
        I assume header will be always be in the first row.
        I assume data are case sensitive.
        We just need to print those duplicate record not to save anywhere. 
Design:
        Created FileUtilities class library which will process CSV file and return duplicate record.
        Created Console application with CSVFilePath and ColumnName as configurable in app.config to figure out duplicate row.
        Add CSV file as part of solution
 
Testing :
